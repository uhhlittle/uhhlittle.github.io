      <p>Hi! I'm a creative problem solver with a background in marketing,
        music-composition, and project-management. As a new web-developer I am
        tackling one challenge at a time, adapting to new technologies, and
        exchanging new personal discoveries with other developers in the community.
        Feel free to take a look at my recent projects, visit my GitHub Repo, and contact me
        with any feedback or questions!
      </p>

    <h2>Recent Projects</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><h3><a href="herokulink.com">Fridge Flex</a></h3>
        <p>Make the most of your groceries with this full encompassing app "Fridge Flex". Using a
          back end server object, the user places leftover items in their fridge, and
          is able to search for recipes using those ingredients, save their favorites, and
          make a customized grocery list for their next trip.</p></li>
      <li><h3><a href="herokulink.com">Developer Blog</a></h3>
        <p>Catch a glimpse of the metamorphosis- a musician
        turned web-developer. In my personal blog, I found a way to enhance my coding skills,
        gain a deeper understanding of new concepts, and help a non-programmer see
        through the looking glass- the coke-bottle looking glass.</p></li>
      <li><h3><a href="herokulink.com">Marijuana Policy Tracker</a></h3>
        <p>In this group project,
          we were able to execute a UX Designer's vision- presenting the user with
          data that clearly reflects the changing marijuana policy on a national scale.</p></li>
      <li><h3><a href="herokulink.com">Spanish Language Flashcards</a></h3>
        <p>Baby's first programming project.
          Three weeks into the WDI immersion program, we were asked to complete our
          first individual builds. Please view my first iteration of the project
          <a href="githubrepolink.com">here.</p></li>
